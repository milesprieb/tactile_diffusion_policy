## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

We recommend [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) instead of the standard anaconda distribution for faster installation: 
```console
$ mamba env create -f conda_environment.yaml
```
### ü¶æ Real Robot
Hardware (for Push-T):
* 1x [UR5-CB3](https://www.universal-robots.com/cb3) or [UR5e](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur5-robot/) ([RTDE Interface](https://www.universal-robots.com/articles/ur/interface-communication/real-time-data-exchange-rtde-guide/) is required)
* 2x [RealSense D415](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d415/)
* 1x [3Dconnexion SpaceMouse](https://3dconnexion.com/us/product/spacemouse-wireless/) (for teleop)
* 1x [Millibar Robotics Manual Tool Changer](https://www.millibar.com/manual-tool-changer/) (only need robot side)
* 1x 3D printed [End effector](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a818888644a15afa6cc68ee5/w/2885b48b018cda84f425beca/e/3e8771c2124cee024edd2fed?renderMode=0&uiState=63ffcba6631ca919895e64e5)
* 1x 3D printed [T-block](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/f1140134e38f6ed6902648d5/w/a78cf81827600e4ff4058d03/e/f35f57fb7589f72e05c76caf?renderMode=0&uiState=63ffcbc9af4a881b344898ee)
* USB-C cables and screws for RealSense

Software:
* Ubuntu 20.04.3 (tested)
* Mujoco dependencies: 
`sudo apt install libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglfw3 patchelf`
* [RealSense SDK](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/distribution_linux.md)
* Spacemouse dependencies: 
`sudo apt install libspnav-dev spacenavd; sudo systemctl start spacenavd`
* Conda environment `mamba env create -f conda_environment_real.yaml`

## ü¶æ Demo, Training and Eval on a Real Robot
Make sure your UR5 robot is running and accepting command from its network interface (emergency stop button within reach at all time), your RealSense cameras plugged in to your workstation (tested with `realsense-viewer`) and your SpaceMouse connected with the `spacenavd` daemon running (verify with `systemctl status spacenavd`).

Start the demonstration collection script. Press "C" to start recording. Use SpaceMouse to move the robot. Press "S" to stop recording. 
```console
(robodiff)[diffusion_policy]$ python demo_real_robot.py -o data/demo_pusht_real --robot_ip 192.168.0.204
```

This should result in a demonstration dataset in `data/demo_pusht_real` with in the same structure as our example [real Push-T training dataset](https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/data/training/pusht_real.zip).

To train a Diffusion Policy, launch training with config:
```console
(robodiff)[diffusion_policy]$ python train.py --config-name=train_diffusion_unet_real_image_workspace task.dataset_path=data/demo_pusht_real
```
Edit [`diffusion_policy/config/task/real_pusht_image.yaml`](./diffusion_policy/config/task/real_pusht_image.yaml) if your camera setup is different.

Assuming the training has finished and you have a checkpoint at `data/outputs/blah/checkpoints/latest.ckpt`, launch the evaluation script with:
```console
python eval_real_robot.py -i data/outputs/blah/checkpoints/latest.ckpt -o data/eval_pusht_real --robot_ip 192.168.0.204
```
Press "C" to start evaluation (handing control over to the policy). Press "S" to stop the current episode.

## ü©π Adding a Task
Read and imitate:
* `diffusion_policy/dataset/pusht_image_dataset.py`
* `diffusion_policy/env_runner/pusht_image_runner.py`
* `diffusion_policy/config/task/pusht_image.yaml`

Make sure that `shape_meta` correspond to input and output shapes for your task. Make sure `env_runner._target_` and `dataset._target_` point to the new classes you have added. When training, add `task=<your_task_name>` to `train.py`'s arguments.
